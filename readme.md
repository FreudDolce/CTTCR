# The CATCR Model

The CATCR model comprises two components: CATCR-D and CATCR-G. CATCR-D is a discriminative model that predicts epitope-CDR3-beta pairs, while CATCR-G is a generative model designed to generate CDR3-beta sequences that bind to a given epitope.

## Environment Requirements:

- Python  3.9.18
- PyTorch  2.1.0
- CUDA 12.2

## Training and Testing Data

The train and test data used for this model can be downloaded from [https://pan.baidu.com/s/1q_yAdiEoH0bvPDXlbr66Pw?pwd=catr].
The pre-trained model is available at [pan.baidu.com/s/1jMYhVIV4M1rAq20HGgqAHw?pwd=catr].

The internal test data includes "seen" epitopes with "unseen" CDR3 sequences.
The external test data includes both "unseen" epitopes and CDR3 sequences.
The PDB data was generated by OpenAI, using a PyTorch version of AlphaFold2.

## Data Preprocessing Tools

We provide a data processing tool to preprocess the sequence and PDB data in DataTransferTools.py.

- The PDB2PositionFrame module converts .pdb files into Pandas DataFrames.
- The RepDistanceAndSequenceMatrix module generates training data for a given sequence.
- Note: A segment-based coding method is recommended. The correspondence between peptide sequences and their codes is listed in node_index.csv.

## Training and Testing Procedures

- The CATCR model consists of three modules: the discriminator (CATCR-D), the residue contact matrix transformer (RCMT), and the generative model (CATCR-G).
- Train CATCR-D using SupTrain.py.
- Train the RCMT using StructureTransformer.py.
- Train CATCR-G using e2t_Generator.py.
- Note: in the training of RCMT and CATCR-G, a pretrained epitope encoder is recommonded. Our pretrained models were provided at [https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jMYhVIV4M1rAq20HGgqAHw?pwd=catr], or you can train the encoder from beginning.


## Demo

- The demo for CATCR-D is `D_test.py', and demo from CATCR-G is `BeamSearch.py`
- We provide the demo data in [https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nTzZLeauK9v0wHngg0NtgQ?pwd=catr].
- To run the demo programmes, you can download the demodata from [https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nTzZLeauK9v0wHngg0NtgQ?pwd=catr].
